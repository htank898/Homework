Write a Definition Statement:
- I want to build an application that tracks the trades of congresspeople and provides stock recommendations to the user based on trades of representatives throughout the house and senate
Define your Audience:
- My audience is young day traders, 22-35 years old who are interested in aggressive investing
Outline the content of the application:
- What do I want on each page?
	- On the landing page I want to showcase the trading performance of the top investors on capitol hill as well as the biggest and most recent trades that have been posted by them
- What do I want the functionality of each page to be?
	- For now it just monitoring the trades and performance of congress-peoples stock portfolios
		- The landing page would be top performers
		- The second page could be the portfolios of those in the senate
		- The third page could be those in the house
		- Perhaps a news page as well that highlights some of the stocks which are being traded at a high volume
		- It would likely also be wise to put together a page that does a "customer story" of one of the most successful insider trades that a congressperson ever pulled off.
		- Eventually I would like to create a function that allows you to automate trading to mimic a certain congresspersons portfolio
- What is the purpose of my application?

	- Fonts:
